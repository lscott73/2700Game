      <p>Welcome to the Hero Card Game! Here's how to play:</p>
      <section>
         <div class="isolate">
           <div class="noise">Click on "Draw Cards Player 1" and "Draw Cards Player 2" to draw three cards for each player.
            Each card has a point value based on its rank (2-10, J, Q, K, A).
            The player with the highest total points gets a hero assigned based on the point system.
            Click on "Reveal Winner" to see the result of the battle.
            The player with the stronger hero wins the round!
